If you don’t have a website you could be missing out on thousands of dollars as potential customers go to your competitors instead. That said, a bad website can also hurt your business.

A lot can go wrong with a website—there’s a reason large organizations have teams of highly specialized experts supporting their web operations. As a small business owner you’re likely managing it all on your own or maybe you’ve delegated this task to someone who is “good with computers.”

Bear with me for a moment and picture a three-legged stool. If one of the legs is weaker than the others, you’ll take a tumble when you try to sit on it. Websites are much the same. A good website needs a strong foundation in three different pillars: how it’s built (aka the technical stuff), what it says (aka the content stuff), and what it looks like (aka the design stuff). Weaknesses in one or more of these pillars will result in a worse user experience and could drive your customers elsewhere.

Whether you’re running your website yourself or paying someone else to do it for you, here are nine website problems that could be quietly killing your business.

## Technical problems

### Website never loads

Every second your website takes to load you lose more and more visitors. It’s widely accepted that if a website takes more than 3 seconds to load you’ve already lost 40% of your visitors (this behavior is known as bouncing).

Obviously, this is a problem because that’s a significant loss of potential sales, but it gets worse.

People who leave a site because of a bad experience (like slow loading) are 88% less likely to return to it again in the future. In other words, your slow website may have cost you repeated future sales too. But that’s not all.

Google uses site speed as a ranking factor. Ranking is complicated, but if everything else is equal, a fast website will rank higher than a slow one. Bounce rate isn’t a direct ranking factor, but it signals low-quality content or a poor user experience and that can lower your ranking over time.

The result of this? Your ranking drops in search results and you get less organic traffic. The visitors you do get continue to bounce from the long wait. You get de-ranked even further. You might try advertising to get more traffic, but that’s just wasting money as those visitors also bounce.

But what about the 60% of customers who don’t bounce? You might ask. “They’re happy, loyal customers!” Maybe, but a study found that a 1-second delay decreases customer satisfaction by 16%. If that dissatisfaction rate is linear, the 3-second delay that cost you 40% of potential customers, has made the ones that stuck around 48% less happy.

The bottom line: make sure your website is as fast as possible. Use tools like [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to test its performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Mobile isn’t supported

Most visitors to your website are likely using a mobile device. If you search “mobile vs desktop website traffic” you’ll see reports of mobile usage topping 80% and others putting it just over 50%. That’s a wide range, but regardless mobile users likely make up a significant source of your traffic.

It’s critical for your website to look good and work correctly on people’s phones. Really it should look good and work on any device, but phones and computers are by far more common than tablets. Anyways, to do this your website needs to be responsive and designed with multiple breakpoints.

You can check your website’s responsiveness by opening it on your computer. Make sure you aren’t in full screen mode and then drag the corner of the window around to change the height and width to different sizes. The layout and content should shift around in response to the screen size. If it doesn’t or it looks really bad at certain sizes, you have a serious problem.

Just as people leave when the website takes too long to load, they’ll also bounce if it looks bad or is unusable on their device.
