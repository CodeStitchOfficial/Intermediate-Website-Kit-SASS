            This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
            that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
            content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
            to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
            content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
            of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
            about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                            Anyone can make a website with Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress, but that doesn't guarantee it'll be good. <strong>A lot can go wrong with a website</strong>, especially if you're inexperienced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Platforms like WordPress can suffer from slow load times and bloated code. By default, you don't get a fast, optimized website with these tools. You can do it, but you have to work for it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Templates make design easy, but without customization, they can cost you your individuality. You can make a decent-looking website, but it'll look generic without extra effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Everyone should have a fast-loading, quality, and unique website</strong>. When you work with us, you'll get a website that is:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="#designed-for-you">designed for you</a>;</li>
                            <li><a href="#mobile-first">fast, responsive, and mobile-first</a>;</li>
                            <li><a href="#secure">secure and safe from hackers</a>;</li>
                            <li><a href="#intuitive">intuitive and accessible</a>; and</li>
                            <li><a href="#seo">optimized for search engines</a>.</li>

                            We offer <a href="/prices/#standard-website">Standard</a> and <a href="/prices/#subscription-website">Subscription</a> websites. They're the same high-quality website; the difference is how you pay for it.

                            Custom websites designed with you in mind

                            <p>
                                The most successful brands have a strong personality and clear messaging. Too many small businesses have neither.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many customers will first learn of your business through your website. As such, it must be memorable and make a good first impression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Often, a brand's personality and its founder's personality overlap. You pour your heart and soul into your business; it's only natural that it reflects you. When aligned with your brand, you'll exude authenticity and passion and can't help but draw people in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>A template can't capture your essence</strong>. It may look nice, but it won't be you. We don't use templates; we start by getting to know you. The result? A website that excites you because we designed it for <em>you</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your website is only one part of your brand. We offer other <a href="/services/branding/">branding and design services</a> to help you build a cohesive brand. Consistency is key.

                                Too many small business websites look terrible on a phone. They often aren't responsive, meaning the page layout doesn't adjust to the screen size. Most website traffic comes from phones&mdash;your <a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/blog/mobile-first-matters/">mobile experience matters</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://nevamasquerade.design/blog/slow-website-lost-opportunity/">Speed is another essential factor</a>. Studies show that 40% of people abandon a website if it takes more than 3 seconds to load, and most never return.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We address each of these priorities:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We style for mobile first and then add adjustments for larger screens.</li>
                                <li>We check and tweak the design at various screen sizes throughout development.</li>
                                <li>We hand-code every website using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                As a result, we can follow best practices and create streamlined, fast-loading websites. You won't worry about losing customers because of website issues.
                            </p>
                        <h2 id="secure">
                            Sleep easy; your site is secure.
                        </h2>
                            <p>
                                Is your current website safe from hackers? Our websites are, but if you're using WordPress or a similar platform, it may not be.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Websites are either dynamic or static. Think of static websites like grab-and-go sandwiches. Everyone gets the same pre-made thing. Dynamic websites are like made-to-order sandwiches. Users can customize them, but they have to wait for it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the server makes the dynamic website, a hacker can slip in an extra ingredient (an SQL injection). The SQL injection tricks the database into serving malicious code, poisoning the sandwich.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Static websites don't have a database and come pre-assembled, so there's less for the hacker to attack. The sandwich is safe; it's already packaged. Bad actors can still tamper with it, but there's less risk.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dynamic websites offer many advantages but aren't worth the risk if your needs are simple. Static websites offer more security and need less maintenance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We use HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt data transmission. Adding a key layer of security to protect your website further.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Bad websites cost money</strong>. They may not cost much out-of-pocket, but you'll lose sales over time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why do people abandon a website?
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>They don't wait for it to load.</li>
                                <li>They can't find what they need.</li>
                                <li>They don't know what you sell or how to buy.</li>
                                <li>They can't use the website.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                After someone leaves your website for one of these reasons, they won't return. Your competition will get the sale, not you.

                                Advertising can be effective, but it can get expensive. Search engine optimization, or SEO, gets you organic traffic without ads.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SEO can feel overwhelming, counterintuitive, mysterious, and slow, but it's also necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two types of SEO: on-page and off-page. On-page SEO involves things on your website that you can control. For example, you need to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>add title tags and meta descriptions,</li>
                                <li>follow URL best practices,</li>
                                <li>use header tags,</li>
                                <li>structure content,</li>
                                <li>optimize images, and</li>
                                <li>ensure the website supports mobile devices.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We do the above to optimize your on-page SEO. We don't charge extra for this work; every web developer should do it by default.
