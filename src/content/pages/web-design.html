            This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
            that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
            content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
            to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
            content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
            of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
            about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                            Anyone can make a website with Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress, but that doesn't guarantee it'll be good. <strong>A lot can go wrong with a website</strong>, especially if you're inexperienced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Platforms like WordPress can suffer from <strong>slow load times</strong> and <strong>bloated code</strong>. By default, you don't get a fast, optimized website with these tools. You can do it, but you have to work for it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Templates</strong> make design easy but can <strong>cost you your individuality</strong> without customization. You can make a decent-looking website, but it'll look generic without extra effort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everyone should have a <strong>fast-loading</strong>, <strong>quality</strong>, and <strong>unique</strong> website. When you work with us, you'll get a website that is:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="#designed-for-you">designed for you</a>;</li>
                            <li><a href="#mobile-first">fast, responsive, and mobile-first</a>;</li>
                            <li><a href="#secure">secure and safe from hackers</a>;</li>
                            <li><a href="#intuitive">intuitive and accessible</a>; and</li>
                            <li><a href="#seo">optimized for search engines</a>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            We offer <a href="/prices/#standard-website">Standard</a> and <a href="/prices/#subscription-website">Subscription</a> websites. They're the same high-quality website; the difference is how you pay for it.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="designed-for-you">
                            Custom websites designed with you in mind
                        </h2>
                            <p>
                                The most successful brands have a <strong>strong personality</strong> and <strong>clear messaging</strong>. Too many small businesses have neither.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many customers will first learn of your business through your website. As such, it must be memorable and make a good first impression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Often, a <strong>brand's personality</strong> and its <strong>founder's personality overlap</strong>. You pour your heart and soul into your business; it's only natural that it reflects you. When aligned with your brand, you'll exude authenticity and passion and can't help but draw people in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>A template can't capture your essence</strong>. It may look nice, but it won't be you. We don't use templates; we start by getting to know you. The result? A website that excites you because we designed it for <em>you</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your <strong>website</strong> is only <strong>one part of your brand</strong>. We offer other <a href="/services/branding/">branding and design services</a> to help you build a cohesive brand. Consistency is key.
                            </p>
                        <h2 id="mobile-first">
                            Mobile first and lightning fast
                        </h2>
                            <p>
                                Too many small business websites look terrible on a phone. They often aren't <strong>responsive</strong>, meaning the page layout doesn't <strong>adjust to the screen size</strong>. Most website <strong>traffic</strong> comes from <strong>phones</strong>&mdash;your mobile experience matters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Speed is another essential factor. Studies show that <strong>40% of people abandon a website if it takes 3 seconds to load</strong>, and most never return.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We address each of these priorities:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We <strong>style for mobile first</strong> and then add adjustments for larger screens.</li>
                                <li>We <strong>check</strong> and tweak the <strong>design at various screen sizes</strong> throughout development.</li>
                                <li>We <strong>hand-code every website</strong> using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                As a result, we can follow <strong>best practices</strong> and create <strong>streamlined, fast-loading websites</strong>. You won't worry about losing customers because of website issues.
                            </p>
                        <h2 id="secure">
                            Sleep easy; your site is secure.
                        </h2>
                            <p>
                                Is your current website safe from hackers? Our websites are, but if you're using <strong>WordPress</strong> or a similar platform, <strong>it may not be</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Websites are either <strong>dynamic</strong> or <strong>static</strong>. Think of static websites like grab-and-go sandwiches. Everyone gets the same pre-made thing. Dynamic websites are like made-to-order sandwiches. Users can customize them, but they have to wait for it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the server makes the <strong>dynamic website</strong>, a hacker can slip in an extra ingredient (an SQL injection). The <strong>SQL injection tricks the database</strong> into serving malicious code, <strong>poisoning the sandwich</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Static websites</strong> don't have a database and come pre-assembled, so <strong>there's less for the hacker to attack</strong>. The sandwich is safe; it's already packaged. Bad actors can still tamper with it, but there's less risk.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Dynamic websites</strong> offer many advantages but <strong>aren't worth the risk</strong> if your needs are simple. <strong>Static websites</strong> offer <strong>more security</strong> and <strong>need less maintenance</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We use <strong>HTTPS</strong> and <strong>SSL/TLS certificates</strong> to encrypt data transmission. Adding a key layer of security to protect your website further.

                            <p>
                                <strong>Bad websites cost money</strong>. They may not cost much out-of-pocket, but you'll lose sales over time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why do people abandon websites?
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>They <strong>don't wait</strong> for it to <strong>load</strong>.</li>
                                <li>They <strong>can't find</strong> what they <strong>need</strong>.</li>
                                <li>They <strong>don't know</strong> what you <strong>sell</strong> or how to <strong>buy</strong>.</li>
                                <li>They <strong>can't use</strong> the <strong>website</strong>.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                After someone leaves your website for one of these reasons, <strong>they won't return</strong>. Your competition will get the sale, not you.

                                <strong>Advertising</strong> can be effective, but it <strong>can get expensive</strong>. <strong>Search engine optimization</strong>, or <strong>SEO</strong>, gets you <strong>organic traffic</strong> without ads.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                SEO can feel overwhelming, counterintuitive, mysterious, and slow, but it's also necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are <strong>two types of SEO</strong>: on-page and off-page. <strong>On-page SEO</strong> involves things on your website that you can control. For example, you need to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>add <strong>title tags</strong> and <strong>meta descriptions</strong>,</li>
                                <li>follow <strong>URL best practices</strong>,</li>
                                <li>use <strong>header tags</strong>,</li>
                                <li><strong>structure content</strong>,</li>
                                <li><strong>optimize images</strong>, and</li>
                                <li>ensure the website <strong>supports mobile devices</strong>.</li>
                            </ul>
