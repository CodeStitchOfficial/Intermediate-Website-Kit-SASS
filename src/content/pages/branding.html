            This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
            that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
            content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
            to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
            content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
            of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
            about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                    <p>
                        Your business may be small, but your brand doesn't have to be. <strong>Every business</strong>, including yours, <strong>is a brand</strong>. You don't need to reach a specific size or level of success before thinking about branding; you can start today. Start with <strong>small, manageable steps</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where do you begin? Focus on being <strong>consistent</strong> and <strong>strategic</strong>. Everything you produce should look and sound like it came from you. Consistency is key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the strategy side, everything you create should <strong>serve a purpose</strong>. Don't make it if it doesn't contribute to a business goal or solve a customer's problem. A good strategy keeps you <strong>focused</strong> and <strong>on-message</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your website is a key part of your brand, but it's only one part. We offer <strong>graphic design</strong> and <strong>brand strategy services</strong> to help you do more with your brand. Our services include:

                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            In 2025, <strong>most marketing campaigns include social media</strong>. It lets you:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>reach customers</strong> at all stages of your marketing funnel,</li>
                            <li><strong>target specific profiles</strong> with your ad spend,</li>
                            <li><strong>pursue organic engagement</strong> at no added cost, and</li>
                            <li><strong>gain user-generated content</strong> as happy customers talk about your business.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Social media has its downsides, too. But whether you love it or hate it, it isn't going anywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You need to <strong>brand your business accounts</strong>. Everything, from your profile to your posts, should look like your business.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Use social media banners with purpose.
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                If it's available, <strong>use your banner image to increase conversions</strong>. Some platforms don't have this feature, but many do, so use it when you can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Go to your profile and look for a <strong>wide image stretching across the top of the page</strong>. If it's there, fill it up with a digital billboard. You want to <strong>highlight your unique selling proposition</strong> and a <strong>call to action</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your <strong>unique selling proposition (USP)</strong> states why people should buy from you and not the other guy. <strong>What sets you apart?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <strong>call to action</strong>, or <strong>CTA</strong>, directs the prospect to the next step. It should move them <strong>down your marketing funnel</strong> and <strong>closer to converting</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We come in handy for the final piece. We'll take the copy, add elements from the website, and, like magic, you'll have a <a href="/prices#social-banner">compelling banner image</a>.
                            </p>
                        <h3>
                            Grab attention with eye-catching graphics.
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                People have <strong>short attention spans</strong>. On social media, you first have to get them to <strong>stop scrolling</strong> and then <strong>keep their attention</strong>. Graphics can help with the first part.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to successful social media content. A lot depends on the platform. Regardless, you need to include a <strong>hook</strong> to <strong>create curiosity</strong> and <strong>draw the viewer in</strong> for more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can create <a href="/prices#social-graphic">social media graphics</a> for you; you only need to provide the content. But why should we make your graphics when you can do it on Canva? To ensure consistency for your brand:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A <strong>Canva template won't align with the website</strong>. We can create custom designs that match your other brand assets.</li>
                                <li>If the person who creates your website also makes your graphics, both will be theÂ <strong>same quality</strong>.</li>
                            </ol>
                    <h2 id="print">
                        Print isn't dead; you still need some paper.
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            Digital is the new way to do business, but you may still need some paper goods like <strong>business cards</strong> or <strong>stationery</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Business cards, letterhead, and envelopes are long-term investments. They also <strong>need to match</strong> every other touchpoint your customers will see. <strong>If things clash</strong>, your customers could:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>get confused</strong>,</li>
                            <li><strong>lose confidence</strong> in you, and</li>
                            <li><strong>take their business elsewhere</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Avoid that with <a href="/prices#business-cards">business cards</a> and <a href="/prices#letterhead-envelopes">stationery</a> that match your website and socials.

                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            Humans love stories; we're wired for them. <strong>Research shows</strong> that our <strong>brains respond to narratives</strong>&mdash;they're <strong>more memorable</strong> and <strong>persuasive</strong>.</p>
                        <p>
                            People have been telling stories for millennia. Joseph Campbell describes this <strong>hero's journey</strong> in <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces.</em> It's present everywhere, from ancient myths to modern movies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Novels and movies aren't the only place writers can use the hero's journey&mdash;<strong>brands can apply it, too</strong>. In <em>Building a StoryBrand</em>, Donald Miller condenses Campbell's 12 steps into <strong>7 for use in marketing</strong>. They are:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A <strong>character</strong> (your customer)</li>
                            <li>Has a <strong>problem</strong> (their struggles)</li>
                            <li>They meet a <strong>guide</strong> (your brand)</li>
                            <li>Who gives them a <strong>plan</strong> (the steps to get your solution)</li>
                            <li>And calls them to <strong>action</strong> (your CTAs)</li>
                            <li>They <strong>succeed</strong> (they buy your offer) or <strong>fail</strong> (they don't buy it)</li>
                            <li>And <strong>transform</strong> (from struggling to successful).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            This framework creates <strong>engaging</strong> and <strong>persuasive messaging</strong> that resonates with your audience. <strong>The most successful brands tell stories</strong>.

                            We can help you develop your <a href="/prices#brand-narrative">brand narrative</a>. You'll answer questions, and then we'll craft your story. You can take our <strong>talking points</strong> and <strong>use them on</strong> your:

                        <p>
                            A <strong>brand style guide</strong> is a <strong>shortcut</strong> and <strong>guardrail</strong>, not a creative roadblock. When followed, it <strong>guarantees consistency</strong>. Style guides are well <strong>worth investing in</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Style guides can vary in length and detail</strong>. For a small business, your style guide doesn't need to take many months to create. You want details without being too detailed.
