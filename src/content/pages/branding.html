            This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
            that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
            content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
            to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
            content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
            of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
            about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                    <p>
                        Your business may be small, but your brand doesn't have to be. Every business, including yours, is a brand. You don't need to reach a specific size or level of success before thinking about branding; you can start today. Start with small, manageable steps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where do you begin? <strong>Focus on being consistent and strategic</strong>. Everything you produce should look and sound like it came from you. Consistency is key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the strategy side, everything you create should serve a purpose. Don't make it if it doesn't contribute to a business goal or solve a customer's problem. A good strategy keeps you focused and on-message.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your website is a key part of your brand, but it's only one part. We offer graphic design and brand strategy services to help you do more with your brand. Our services include:

                        Social media for small business
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            In 2025, most marketing campaigns include social media. It lets you:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>reach customers at all stages of your marketing funnel,</li>
                            <li>target specific profiles with your ad spend,</li>
                            <li>pursue organic engagement at no added cost, and</li>
                            <li>gain user-generated content as happy customers talk about your business.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Social media has its downsides, too. But whether you love it or hate it, it isn't going anywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You need to brand your business accounts. Everything, from your profile to your posts, should look like your business.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Use social media banners with purpose.
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                If it's available, <strong>use your banner image to increase conversions</strong>. Some platforms don't have this feature, but many do, so use it when you can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Go to your profile and look for a wide image stretching across the top of the page. If it's there, fill it up with a digital billboard. You want to highlight your unique selling proposition and a call to action.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your unique selling proposition (USP) states why people should buy from you and not the other guy. What sets you apart?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The call to action, or CTA, directs the prospect to the next step. It should move them down your marketing funnel and closer to converting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We come in handy for the final piece. We'll take the copy, add elements from the website, and, like magic, you'll have a <a href="/prices/#social-banner">compelling banner image</a>.
                            </p>
                        <h3>
                            Grab attention with eye-catching graphics.
                        </h3>
                            <p>
                                People have short attention spans. On social media, you first have to get them to stop scrolling and then keep their attention. Graphics can help with the first part.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to successful social media content. A lot depends on the platform. Regardless, you need to include a hook to create curiosity and draw the viewer in for more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can <a href="/prices/#social-graphic">create social media graphics</a> for you; you only need to provide the content. But why should we make your graphics when you can do it on Canva? To ensure consistency for your brand:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A Canva template won't align with the website. We can create custom designs that match your other brand assets.</li>
                                <li>If the person who creates your website also makes your graphics, both will be the same quality.</li>
                            </ol>
                    <h2 id="print">
                        Print isn't dead; you still need some paper.
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            Digital is the new way to do business, but you may still need some paper goods like business cards or stationery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Business cards, letterhead, and envelopes are long-term investments. They also need to match every other touchpoint your customers will see. If things clash, your customers could:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>get confused,</li>
                            <li>lose confidence in you, and</li>
                            <li>take their business elsewhere.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Avoid that with <a href="/prices/#business-cards">business cards</a> and <a href="/prices/#letterhead-envelopes">stationery</a> that match your website and socials.

                        Tell stories to engage and persuade
                    </h2>
                        <p>
                            Humans love stories; we're wired for them. Research shows that our brains respond to narratives&mdash;they're more memorable and persuasive.
                        <p>
                            People have been telling stories for millennia. Joseph Campbell describes this hero's journey in <em>The Hero with a Thousand Faces.</em> It's present everywhere, from ancient myths to modern movies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Novels and movies aren't the only place writers can use the hero's journey&mdash;brands can apply it, too. In <em>Building a StoryBrand</em>, Donald Miller condenses Campbell's 12 steps into 7 for use in marketing. They are:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A character (your customer)</li>
                            <li>Has a problem (their struggles)</li>
                            <li>They meet a guide (your brand)</li>
                            <li>Who gives them a plan (the steps to get your solution)</li>
                            <li>And calls them to action (your CTAs)</li>
                            <li>They succeed (they buy your offer) or fail (they don't buy it)</li>
                            <li>And transform (from struggling to successful).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            This framework creates engaging and persuasive messaging that resonates with your audience. <strong>The most successful brands tell stories</strong>.

                        Style guides aren't restrictive; they're freeing.

                        <p>
                            A brand style guide is a shortcut and guardrail, not a creative roadblock. When followed, it guarantees consistency. Style guides are well worth investing in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Style guides can vary in length and detail. For a small business, your style guide doesn't need to take many months to create. You want details without being too detailed.
