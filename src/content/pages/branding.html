            This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
            that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
            content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
            to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
            content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
            of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
            about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                    <p>
                        Your business may be small, but your brand doesn't have to be. Branding isn't restricted to a certain revenue threshold. Every business, including yours, is a brand. You don't need to reach a specific size or level of success before you can think about branding, you can start today. You also don't need to achieve top-tier branding at first. Start with small, manageable steps and then grow over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So where do you begin? Focus on being consistent and strategic. Everything you produce should look and sound like it came from you. Over time, you'll build a reputation and people will think of your business when they need you. Your business will also look more professional and organized. Consistency is key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the strategy side, everything you create should serve a purpose. If it doesn't contribute to a business goal or solve a customer's problem, you should question why you're making it. A good strategy also keeps you focused and on-message. This can help you do more with less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can help you with consistency. Your website is an important part of your brand, but it's that, a part. A website only does so much on its own. It's much more effective when it's a piece in a larger strategy.

                    <h2>Social media for small business</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 2025, few marketing campaigns don't include social media. You can reach customers at all stages of your marketing funnel. You can target very specific profiles with your ad spend. Or pursue organic engagement at no added cost. You can gain user-generated content as happy customers talk about your awesome business. It has its downsides too, but love it or hate it social media isn't going anywhere any time soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your business is on any social media platforms, you need to brand your accounts. Every touchpoint should look like it's part of your business. On social media, this applies to your profile banner (if applicable) and all your posts.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Use social media banners with purpose</h3>
                            <p>
                                If it's available, use your banner image to increase conversions. You can do this by encouraging people to buy from you and telling them what their next step should be. Some platforms don't have this feature (looking at you Instagram and TikTok), but many do, so use it when you can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Go to your profile and look for a glorious wide expanse stretching across the top of page. If it's there, you need to fill it up with a digital billboard. But don't go overboard, you don't need to cram every little thing you do into this graphic. In fact, you shouldn't do that---it'll be overwhelming and nobody will read it. Instead, you want to highlight your unique selling proposition and a call to action.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your unique selling proposition (USP) is the reason why people should buy from you and not the other guy. It should be short. Like a single sentence short. Features are not USPs, and neither is price. Think more like how your business is different from everyone else's. What sets you apart?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The call to action, or CTA, directs the prospect to their next step. It could be to visit your website, join your mailing list, or to schedule a free consultation. Whatever it is, it should move them down your marketing funnel and closer to converting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The final piece is to present your USP and CTA in an appealing graphic that fits in with the rest of your brand. This is where we come in. We'll take the copy, add in elements from the website, and voila you now have a compelling banner image.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Grab attention with eye-catching graphics</h3>
                            <p>
                                People have short attention spans. On social media, you first have to get them to stop scrolling, then you have to keep their attention. Graphics can help with the first part.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach for successful social media content. A lot of it depends on the platform. You also want to include a hook to create curiosity and draw the viewer in for more. For example, graphics are helpful for:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>getting views on YouTube with a curiosity generating thumbnail,</li>
                                <li>stopping scrolls on LinkedIn with an informative, tip-filled carousel, or</li>
                                <li>drawing likes and shares on Facebook on your latest promotion.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We can create your graphics for you, all you need to do is provide the content. Why have us make graphics when you can do it on Canva yourself? First, a Canva template won't align with the website as well as what we can create with Adobe Creative Cloud. Second, if the person who makes your website also makes your graphics, both will be to the same level of standard. Two different ways to ensure consistency for your brand.
                            </p>
                    <h2>Print isn't dead, you still need some paper</h2>
                        <p>
                            Digital is the new way to do business, but you may still need some paper goods like business cards or stationery. If your business is more traditional, and less digital, you definitely need these.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Business cards, letterhead, and envelopes rarely change and can be costly to replace. When you invest in them, it should be for the long-term. They also need to match every other touchpoint your customers will see. If things clash, your customers could get confused and lose confidence in you. If they aren't confident in your professionalism and abilities, they may go elsewhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Avoid that with business cards and stationery that match your website and socials.
                        </p>
                    <h2>Style guides aren't restrictive, they're freeing</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some may say that rules limit creativity. They're wrong, at least when it comes to working within a brand system. A brand style guide serves as a shortcut and guardrails. When followed, it guarantees consistency. Creating a style guide identifies any non-intentional choices that weren't strategic. Style guides are well worth investing in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Style guides can vary in length and detail. Some may be a single page, others might be more akin to a short book. The shorter it is, the less detailed it will be. For a small business, your style guide should cover how to use each component. But it doesn't need to take many, many months to create. Detailed, but not too detailed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When we create a style guide, we aim for 1-2 pages on each of these topics:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Company mission, vision, and values</li>
                            <li>Logo usage</li>
                            <li>Color palette</li>
                            <li>Typography</li>
                            <li>Imagery</li>
                            <li>Tone and voice</li>
                            <li>Templates (if applicable)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>Overwhelmed? Let's chat</h2>
                        <p>
                            Building a brand can feel overwhelming, but it's worth doing. Baby steps may feel insignificant, but progress is progress. There's a lot more to building a successful brand, but these services will get you started. If you'd like to do more, but aren't sure where to start we are available for consulting. Unfortunately, we can't do everything, even though we'd like to. That said, we're happy to share our knowledge if it'll help you figure out how to do it yourself.
