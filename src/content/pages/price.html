            This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
            that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
            content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
            to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
            content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
            of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
            about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                                We build and run simple, 5-page static websites for service-based small businesses. There are two pricing models for this service. The first, is a Standard Website that you buy outright and pay for upfront. The second is a Subscription Website with a low monthly payment. You may also add-on extra services or features to either website package.

                                    Ideal for business owners who can't afford a large, upfront cost. It's also ideal if you would like to redesign your website every three years or so for no extra cost. Think of it as going from one car lease to the next, but without a new contract. This gives you ongoing value without charging you more. The initial contract is for 12 months, after that we go month to month and you may cancel at any time.
                                </p>

                                    To make this model work, we keep the copyright on subscription websites. Your domain and content you provided is always yours; the design and code are ours. This prevents people from canceling and keeping the website for a fraction of the cost. We want to build strong partnerships that last for years, not churn through lots of clients.

                                        Blogging can be a great way to improve your website's search engine optimization (SEO). We can add a blog for you to manage yourself. To do this, we use Decap CMS. It works with static websites (like what we build). Unlike WordPress, it doesn't have a database so it's lower maintenance and more secure. It's also super easy to use.

                                The word &quot;branding&quot; might make you think of companies like Coca-Cola, Nike, or Apple. But it isn't something that only large corporations can have&mdash;small businesses are brands too. You also don't need a large budget to build your brand. Money helps, of course, but as long as you are consistent and strategic you'll do better than everyone who isn't.

                                We can help you be more consistent with all your communications. While we are a web design agency first, websites aren't isolated. A strong website looks and sounds like your social media and printed materials. A weak website clashes with everything else you're doing. To that end, we also offer limited graphic design services to help you build a stronger brand.

A logo works as a profile photo, but the banner should be more than a pretty picture. Use it to drive potential leads into your marketing funnel. Tell potential lead about your unique selling proposition and give them a call-to-action. We can combine this copy with elements from your website to create a compelling banner.

                                    We're available for consultations if you'd like more help with your brand or your web strategy. Unfortunately we can't do everything and had to make some tough choices about what to offer and what to cut. That said, we love sharing our knowledge and nerding out on these topics. If we can help you DIY a few things, let's set up a call and figure out what you need to do!
