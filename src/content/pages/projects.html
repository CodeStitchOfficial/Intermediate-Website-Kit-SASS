{# 
    The starter kit uses the eleventy navigation plugin to render navigation items using data defined within the page,
    making the navigation easy to control in larger projects.
    https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/

    In the starter kit, dropdowns are created by defining a "parent" in the eleventyNavigation frontmatter data of the child
    page (see pages/project-one.html as an example).

    To create the dropdown "parent", which gets rendered as a <span> (as opposed to an <a>) we need to create a blank HTML
    file with the eleventyNavigation frontmatter defined, as shown in this example file.

    Make sure the permalink is set to "false", which prevents a HTML file being made in /public and keeps this page from
    being written to the sitemap.
