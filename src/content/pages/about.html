                    Hi, my name is Tianna Hutchins, and I am an unapologetic cat lover, history nerd, and public servant. In 2018, I joined the U.S. Department of State's web team as a web editor. Today, I'm the team lead overseeing a small team that manages the Department's main website. The website receives millions of visits each month and peaked at over 47,500 pages. Over the past seven years, I've learned a lot. Now, I am a jack-of-all-trades in the world of websites.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    For the next chapter in my career, I want to share my knowledge and experience with people like you. I could look for a corporate job, but I would like to use my skills instead to help small businesses grow. That's why I started Neva Masquerade.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    You don't have to settle for a subpar website and weak branding. I'm ready to help you elevate your brand and grow your business. Are you?

                    How can you shine when your online presence feels like a masquerade? Starting a business is challenging. Feeling lost, overwhelmed, and sometimes like an imposter is easy. Running a business takes a lot of time. You don't have time to grapple with a subpar website and an inconsistent brand. Neva Masquerade was born out of a desire to ease this burden.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    Many small businesses struggle to make their mark, but it doesn't have to be that way. Our custom-coded websites can free you from the hassle of web design so that you can focus on what you do best. We aspire to help businesses like yours thrive.
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    We don't use templates or page builders because every web design should be a partnership. Your website should reflect your vision and personality and not a generic knock-off. Your business deserves to stand out and not blend into the crowded marketplace. We're excited to see what we can build together. When can we start?
